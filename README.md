# # Overview

I created this project to become more familiar with databases, and to learn the sqlite3 library.

# Relational Database

The database used in this program is extremely simple. It consists of one table which contains data that describes physical exercise activities performed by the user

# Development Environment

I wrote this program in VScode IDE in the language of Python. I didn't use any significant libraries aside from sqlite3

# Future Work

- Further improve user input validation throughout the program
- Add more detailed stats that are specific to each type of exercise
